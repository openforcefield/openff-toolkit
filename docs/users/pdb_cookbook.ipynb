    "PDB files are a common way to represent biopolymer structures, but they don't natively contain all of the chemical information required to construct a `Molecule` object(s). However, PDB files are used widely in the molecular simulation community, so OpenFF has implemented functionality to load them.\n",

Additionally, the PDB file must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "For protein atoms:\n",
    "* Atom names and residue names must be consistent with the [Chemical Components Dictonary](https://www.wwpdb.org/data/ccd)\n",

    "* All hydrogens must be explicit\n",

    "* The element of each atom must be identified in the final column of the file\n",
