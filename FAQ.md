# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## What kinds of input files can I apply SMIRNOFF parameters to?

SMIRNOFF force fields use direct chemical perception meaning that, unlike many molecular mechanics (MM) force fields, they apply parameters based on substructure searches acting directly on molecules.
This creates unique opportunities and allows them to encode a great deal of chemistry quite simply, but it also means that the *starting point* for parameter assignment must be well-defined chemically, giving not just the elements and connectivity for all of the atoms of all of the components of your system, but also providing the formal charges and bond orders.

Specifically, to apply SMIRNOFF to a system, you must either:
1. Provide Open Force Field Toolkit [`Molecule`](openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) objects corresponding to the components of your system, or
2. Provide an OpenMM [`Topology`](openff.toolkit.topology.Topology) which includes bond orders and thus can be converted to molecules corresponding to the components of your system

Without this information, our direct chemical perception cannot be applied to your molecule, as it requires the chemical identity of the molecules in your system -- that is, bond order and formal charge as well as atoms and connectivity.
Unless you provide the full chemical identity in this sense, we must attempt to guess or infer the chemical identity of your molecules, which is a recipe for trouble.
Different molecules can have the same chemical graph but differ in bond order and formal charge, or different resonance structures may be treated rather differently by some force fields (e.g. `c1cc(ccc1c2cc[nH+]cc2)[O-]` vs `C1=CC(C=CC1=C2C=CNC=C2)=O`, where the central bond is rotatable in one resonance structure but not in the other) even though they have identical formal charge and connectivity (chemical graph).
A force field which uses the chemical identity of molecules to assign parameters needs to know the exact chemical identity of the molecule you are intending to parameterize.

## Can I use an AMBER (or GROMACS) topology/coordinate file as a starting point for applying a SMIRNOFF force field?

In a word, "no".

Parameter files used by typical molecular dynamics simulation packages do not currently encode enough information to identify the molecules chemically present, or at least not without drawing inferences.
For example, one could take a structure file and infer bond orders based on bond lengths, or attempt to infer bond orders from force constants in a parameter file.
Such inference work is outside the scope of SMIRNOFF.


## What about starting from a PDB file?

PDB files do not in general provide the chemical identity of small molecules contained therein, and thus do not provide suitable starting points for applying SMIROFF to small molecules.
This is especially problematic for PDB files from X-ray crystallography which typically do not include proteins, making the problem even worse.
For our purposes here, however, we assume you begin with the coordinates of all atoms present and the full topology of your system.

Given a PDB file of a hypothetical biomolecular system of interest containing a small molecule, there are several routes available to you for treating the small molecule present:
- Use a cheminformatics toolkit (see below) to infer bond orders
- Identify your ligand from a database; e.g. if it is in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), it will be present in the [Ligand Expo](http://ligand-expo.rcsb.org) meaning that it has a database entry and code you can use to look up its putative chemical identity
- Identify your ligand by name or SMILES string (or similar) from the literature or your collaborators

## What about starting from an XYZ file?

XYZ files generally only contain elements and positions, and are therefore similar in content to PDB files. See the above section "What about starting from a PDB file?" for more information.

## What do you recommend as a starting point?

For application of SMIRNOFF force fields, we recommend that you begin your work with formats which provide the chemical identity of your small molecule (including formal charge and bond order).
This means we recommend one of the following or equivalent:
- A `.sdf`, `.mol`, or `.mol2` file or files for the molecules comprising your system, with correct bond orders and formal charges. (Note: Do NOT generate this from a simulation package or tool which does not have access to bond order information; you may end up with a correct-seeming file, but the bond orders will be incorrect)
- Isomeric SMILES strings for the components of your system
- InCHI strings for the components of your system
- Chemical Identity Registry numbers for the components of your system
- IUPAC names for the components of your system

Essentially, anything which provides the full identity of what you want to simulate (including stereochemistry) should work, though it may require more or less work to get it into an acceptable format.

## I understand the risks and want to perform bond and formal charge inference anyway

If you are unable to provide a molecule in the formats recommended above and want to attempt to infer the bond orders and atomic formal charges, there are tools available elsewhere that can provide guesses for this problem. These tools are not perfect, and the inference problem itself is poorly defined, so you should review each output closely (see our [Core Concepts](users/concepts) for an explanation of what information is needed to construct an OpenFF Molecule). Some tools we know of include:

- the OpenEye toolkits' [`OEPerceiveBondOrders`](https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/python/oechemtk/OEChemFunctions/OEPerceiveBondOrders.html) functionality
- [MDAnalysis' RDKit converter](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/stable/documentation_pages/converters/RDKit.html?highlight=rdkit#module-MDAnalysis.converters.RDKit), with an [example here](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/1126#issuecomment-969712195)
- the Jensen group's [xyz2mol program](https://github.com/jensengroup/xyz2mol/)

## My conda installation of the toolkit doesn't appear to work. What should I try next?

We recommend that you install the toolkit in a fresh conda environment, explicitly passing the channels to be used, in-order:

```shell
conda create -n <my_new_env> -c conda-forge openff-toolkit
conda activate <my_new_env>
```

Installing into a new environment avoids forcing conda to satisfy the dependencies of both the toolkit and all existing packages in that environment.
Taking the approach that conda environments are generally disposable, even ephemeral, minimizes the chances for hard-to-diagnose dependency issues.

## My conda installation of the toolkit STILL doesn't appear to work. 

Many of our users encounter issues that are ultimately due to their terminal finding a different `conda` at higher priority in their `PATH` than the `conda` deployment where OpenFF is installed. To fix this, find the conda deployment where OpenFF is installed. Then, if that folder is something like `~/miniconda3`, run in the terminal:

```shell
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

and then try rerunning and/or reinstalling the Toolkit. 

## The partial charges generated by the toolkit don't seem to depend on the molecule's conformation! Is this a bug?

No! This is the intended behavior. The force field parameters of a molecule should be independent of both their chemical environment and conformation so that they can be used and compared across different contexts. When applying AM1BCC partial charges, the toolkit achieves a deterministic output by ignoring the input conformation and producing several new conformations for the same molecule. Partial charges are then computed based on these conformations. This behavior can be controlled with the `use_conformers` argument to the [assign_partial_charges()](openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.assign_partial_charges) and [compute_partial_charges_am1bcc()](openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule.compute_partial_charges_am1bcc) methods of the [Molecule](openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule) class.


## How can I distribute my own force fields in SMIRNOFF format?

We support conda data packages for distribution of force fields in `.offxml` format! Just add the relevant entry point to `setup.py` and distribute on conda Forge:

```python
entry_points={
    'openforcefield.smirnoff_forcefield_directory' : [
        'my_new_force_field_paths = my_package:get_my_new_force_field_paths',
    ],
}
```

Where `get_my_new_force_field_paths` is a function in the `my_package` module providing a list of strings holding the paths to the directories to search. You should also rename `my_new_force_field_paths` to suit your force field. See [`openff-forcefields`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/blob/ed0d904/setup.py#L57-L61) for an example.
