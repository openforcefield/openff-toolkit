# Examples using external tools

The examples in this directory make heavy use of external tools developed and maintained by other communities than the Open Force Field Initiative.
These notebooks constitute recommended routes for functionality not supported by current OpenFF infrastructure and force fields.

These tools, however, have bugs and some rough edges.
Proceed with **extreme caution** when extending these workflows to novel use cases and always validate outputs generated from these tools.
