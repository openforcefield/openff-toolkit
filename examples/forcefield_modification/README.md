## Manipulating SMIRNOFF parameters after loading into a `ForceField` object

In this example, we'll parameterize a ligand automatically, and then play with its parameters via the `ForceField` class to demonstrate the Toolkit's ability to facilitate force field optimization. For each modification, we'll calculate the energy for the original conformation, and then minimize the energy and visualize the result.
