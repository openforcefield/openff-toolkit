Our internal tests indicate it is reliable for many small-molecule systems, but it is not yet reliable for complex, multi-component systems and there are likely still rough edges throughout.

Note that the OpenFF Toolkit produces partial charges that do not depend on the input conformation of parameterized molecules.
