[Parsley](https://openforcefield.org/force-fields/force-fields/#parsley) is the first generation force field produced by the Open Force Field Initiative. Rather than using atom types like traditional biomolecular force fields, Parsley assigns parameters to a molecule with [fancy subgraph matching](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html). Note that to parameterize a molecule you need more than just the co-ordinates of its atoms; you also need their bonds, bond orders, and formal charges. As a result, `.sdf` files are used in this example; other file types are possible, but they must include this information. Parsley is distributed as an `.offxml` file according to the [SMIRNOFF specification](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smirnoff.html). This file describes all the choices the toolkit has to make to parameterize a molecule.\n",

    "### Open Source Force Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary goal of the Open Force Field Initiative is to make development and use of force fields as open as possible - it's in our name! We believe that open source development practices have a lot to offer the scientific community, whether that science is academic, commercial, or hobbyist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The SMIRNOFF specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The SMIRNOFF specification describes a simple format for describing molecular force fields. We provide and maintain this spec in the hopes that it will allow scientists everywhere to contribute to force field development in a unified way, without taking them away from their favourite simulation package.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMIRNOFF is not just a spec; we're also committed to a reference implementation — that being the OpenFF Toolkit. The Toolkit endeavors to support all the functional forms in both the SMIRNOFF spec and the [`openff-forcefields`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFF force fields are completely specified by the name of the distributed `.offxml` file. We use codenames, version numbers, and tags to accomplish this. This means that as long as a user, designer, or reviewer sees the name of the force field being used, they know exactly what is going in to that simulation. We include parameters that are often treated as implementation details in this specification, so details like the cut-off distance, constraints, modifications to the Lennard-Jones function, and partial charge generation methods are all defined by the name of the force field. \n",
    "\n",
    "As much as possible, we want energy and force to be a deterministic output of combining a molecule and a force field. If an author provides the name of the force field in their methods section, it should be reproducible. The other side of this coin is that we never want to hide the force field from the user. In all our workflows, the name of the force field must be explicitly provided in the code. This improves reproducibility of the code and helps the user take responsibility for their results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Plugin\" support for new force fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenFF Toolkit supports distributing force field files (.offxml) through Conda data packages. Anyone can publish a package on Conda Forge that extends the list of directories the toolkit searches for force fields, allowing anyone to produce force fields without requiring their own tooling, in a format that is designed to be converted to a multitude of simulation packages. See the [FAQ](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format) for more details.\n"

    "OpenMM makes it easy to run molecular simulations without leaving Python. The OpenFF toolkit currently exports directly to OpenMM, but no part of the parametrization process is exclusively supported by OpenMM. With ParmEd and other tools, the same systems can be run in other engines. Here we show how to use ParmEd to prepare and run the same workflow in GROMACS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have [another example](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/blob/master/examples/using_smirnoff_in_amber_or_gromacs/convert_to_amber_gromacs.ipynb) that uses ParmEd to produce Amber input files too, and also to validate single point energies.\n",

    "[ParmEd](https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd) is able to read, write, combine, and edit topologies and structures from several different simulation programs, including CHARMM, OpenMM, Amber, and GROMACS. Here, we'll use it to convert our OpenMM `System` to a format we can visualize, and later we'll use it to convert our prepared system to another simulation package.\n",
    "\n",
    "ParmEd doesn't support constraints from OpenMM because different simulation packages have conflicting ways of specifying them.
