    "# Toolkit Showcase: Prepare and run a protein-ligand simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Open Force Field Toolkit! This introductory example will demonstrate how to prepare a system for Molecular Dynamics that combines solvent, a ligand using the Sage open force field, and a protein using a standard Amber force field. We'll take a pre-docked benchmark example and solvate it, assemble the system, parametrize it, and finally simulate it with OpenMM and visualize the results, all without leaving the notebook. Have fun!"

For now, we don't have any single SMIRNOFF force field that can handle both proteins and small molecules; the Rosemary 3.0.0 force field will support this, but it's not expected until 2023. As an alternative, we'll combine the Sage small molecule force field with the SMIRNOFF port of Amber ff14SB. These force fields parametrize non-bonded parameters in similar ways and with the same functional form, so we don't expect any outrageous artifacts, but they also haven't been carefully tested together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The star of the show here is the Sage 2.0.0 force field. [Sage] is the latest force field produced by the Open Force Field Initiative. Rather than using atom types like traditional biomolecular force fields, Sage assigns parameters to a molecule by [matching actual chemical moieties]. Note that to parametrize a molecule you need more than just the co-ordinates of its atoms; you also need their bonds, bond orders, and formal charges. As a result, `.sdf` files are used in this example; other file types are possible, but they must include this information. Sage is distributed as an `.offxml` file according to the [SMIRNOFF specification]. This file describes all the choices the toolkit has to make to parametrize a molecule. Sage also includes the TIP3P water model, which is appropriate for Amber ff14SB too.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we combine multiple SMIRNOFF force fields into one, we provide them in an order from general to specific. Sage includes parameters that could be applied to a protein, but they're general across all molecules; ff14SB's parameters are specific to proteins. Since the Toolkit always applies the last parameters that match a moiety, this order makes sure the right parameters get assigned.\n",

The `Topology` then represents an entire chemical system, which in theory could be modelled in any number of ways. Our `Topology` also includes atom positions and box vectors, but if we thought that was too concrete for our use case we could leave them out and add them after parametrization.\n",

A SMIRNOFF force field is a bunch of rules for applying force field parameters to chemicals via SMARTS patterns. The force field includes everything needed to compute an energy: parameters, charges, functional forms, non-bonded methods and cutoffs, virtual sites, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we've parametrized our `Topology` with our `ForceField` to produce an `Interchange`. This applies all our rules and gives us a system ready to simulate. An `Interchange` can also concretely define positions, velocities, and box vectors, whether they come from the `Topology` or are added after parametrization. Once we have the `Interchange`, we can produce input data for any of the supported MM engines.\n",

We include parameters that are often neglected in force field specifications, such as the non-bonded cut-off distance, ewald methods, constraints, modifications to the Lennard-Jones function, and partial charge generation methods are all defined by the name of the force field. \n",

    "As much as possible, we want energy and force to be a deterministic output of combining a molecule and a force field. If an author provides the name of the force field in their methods section, it should be reproducible. The other side of this coin is that we never want to hide the force field from the user. In all our workflows, the name of the force field must be explicitly provided in the code. This improves reproducibility of the code and helps the user take responsibility for their results. \n",
