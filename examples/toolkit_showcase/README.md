## Toolkit Showcase: Protein-ligand simulation with an OpenFF force field

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/latest?filepath=examples%toolkit_showcase%toolkit_showcase.ipynb)

This introductory example will demonstrate how to prepare a system for Molecular Dynamics that combines solvent, a ligand using the Parsley open force field, and a protein using a standard Amber force field. We'll use a number of tools from the Python molecular science ecosystem to take a pre-docked benchmark example from scratch all the way through to simulation and visualization, all without leaving the notebook.
