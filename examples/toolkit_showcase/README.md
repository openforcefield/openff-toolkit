## Toolkit Showcase: Protein-ligand simulation with an OpenFF force field

This introductory example will demonstrate how to prepare a system for Molecular Dynamics that combines solvent, a ligand using the Sage open force field, and a protein using a standard Amber force field. We'll use a number of tools from the Python molecular science ecosystem to take a pre-docked benchmark example from scratch all the way through to simulation and visualization, all without leaving the notebook.
