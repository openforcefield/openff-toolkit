; MDP file for energy minimising with the Parsley 1.3.0 force field

;    INTEGRATION - EM
integrator              = steep ; Steepest descent energy minimisation
nsteps                  = 10000 ; Maximum of 10000 steps
emtol                   = 1000 ; Stop minimising when greatest force is smaller than 1000 kJ/mol/nm
emstep                  = 0.001 ; Initial step size (nm); default 0.01

;    OUTPUT CONTROL
; Strangely, this is where GROMACS sets all its output control
; mdrun switches don't change anything
nstxout                 = 0 ; only last ; Steps between writing coords to uncompressed output trajectory
nstvout                 = 0 ; only last ; Steps between writing velocities to uncompressed output trajectory
nstfout                 = 0 ; never ; Steps between writing forces to uncompressed output trajectory
nstlog                  = 0 ; only last ; Steps between writing energies to log file
nstenergy               = 0 ; only last ; Steps between writing energies to energy file

;    CUTOFF SCHEME - verlet
; Verlet is faster, more parallelisable, more accurate, supports GPUs
; Only use group for the legacy interactions it supports
cutoff-scheme           = Verlet ; Neighbor searching with a Verlet buffer

;    COULOMB INTERACTIONS
coulombtype             = PME ; Use Particle Mesh Ewald to compute long-range electrostatic interactions
rcoulomb                = 0.9 ; Cutoff for short-range electrostatics; tuned for performance at runtime by GROMACS
verlet-buffer-tolerance = 0.005 ; KJ/mol/ps; energy tolerance for the verlet buffer. Sets rlist
rlist                   = 0.9 ; Cutoff for the short-range neighbour list; overriden by verlet-buffer-tolerance, set here to avoid notes

;    LJ INTERACTIONS
vdwtype                 = Cut-off ; Use a cut-off for vdW interactions
vdw-modifier            = force-switch ; Smoothly switch off the LJ interactions
rvdw                    = 0.9 ; Distance cutoff for the vdW interactions
rvdw-switch             = 0.8 ; where to start switching off the LJ force
DispCorr                = EnerPres ; Correct the energy and pressure for long range dispersion errors

;    CONSTRAINTS - EM
constraints             = None ; Energy minimise without constraints to avoid LINCS warnings
