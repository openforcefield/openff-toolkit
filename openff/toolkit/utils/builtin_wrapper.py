        Parameters
        ----------
        molecule
            Molecule for which partial charges are to be computed
        partial_charge_method
            The charge model to use. One of ['zeros', 'formal_charge']. If None, 'formal_charge'
            will be used.
        use_conformers
            (n_atoms, 3) and dimension of distance. Optional, default = None
            Coordinates to use for partial charge calculation. If None, an appropriate number
            of conformers will be generated.
        strict_n_conformers
            Whether to raise an exception if an invalid number of conformers is provided for the
            given charge method.
            If this is False and an invalid number of conformers is found, a warning will be raised
            instead of an Exception.
        normalize_partial_charges
            Whether to offset partial charges so that they sum to the total formal charge of the molecule.
            This is used to prevent accumulation of rounding errors when the partial charge generation method has
            low precision.
        _cls
            Molecule constructor

        Raises
        ------

        and specifies an invalid number of conformers for the requested method
