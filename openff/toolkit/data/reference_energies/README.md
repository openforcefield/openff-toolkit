- `reference_after_1007.json` - generated by `openff/toolkit/tests/test_energies.py` with conda environment reference_after_1007.txt, corresponds to commit 6ac06efb7d0e91a960325cfc45874500af52274c in PR #948, between 0.9.2 and 0.9.3. 
  This change tracks the effect of partial charge normalization on the reference energies of the test set.
  Note that that PR #948 was superseded by #1007, since it #948 gained an irreconcilably large merge conflict with master during its development.
